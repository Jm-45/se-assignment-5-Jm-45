3. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.

Editor: This is the primary area where you edit your files. You can open multiple editors side by side, both vertically and horizontally.
Primary Side Bar: The Primary Side Bar contains different views, such as the Explorer, which assists you while working on your project. The Explorer view displays your project’s files and folders.
Status Bar: The Status Bar provides information about the opened project and the files you’re editing. It may show details like line and column numbers, Git status, and other relevant indicators.
Activity Bar: Located on the far left-hand side, the Activity Bar lets you switch between various views. It provides context-specific indicators, such as the number of outgoing changes when Git is enabled.
Panel: The Panel is an additional space below the editor region. By default, it contains output, debug information, errors, warnings, and an integrated terminal. You can also move the Panel to the left or right for more vertical space

Keyboard Shortcut:
Mac: Press Shift + Command + P.
Windows/Linux: Press Ctrl + Shift + P.
Application Menu:
Click View > Command Palette.
Once you open the Command Palette, start typing to search for a specific command by its name. Here are some common tasks you can perform using the Command Palette:

Change File Language Mode: Search for “Change Language Mode” to switch the language mode for the current file.
Install Extensions: Type “Extensions: Install Extensions” to browse and install VS Code extensions.
Toggle Line Numbers: Search for “Toggle Line Numbers” to show or hide line numbers in the editor.
Format Document: Use “Format Document” to automatically format your code according to the configured rules.
Run Tasks: Search for task-related commands, such as “Run Build Task” or “Run Test Task,” to execute defined tasks.
Change Themes: Type “Color Theme” to switch between different color themes for the editor.

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.

Finding and Installing Extensions:
To find and install extensions, open VS Code and click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar (or use the shortcut Shift + Command + X on Mac or Ctrl + Shift + X on Windows/Linux).
Search for an extension by name, and click Install to add it to your workspace.
For example, the JavaScript (ES6) Code Snippets extension provides helpful code snippets for JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, React, and HTML1.
